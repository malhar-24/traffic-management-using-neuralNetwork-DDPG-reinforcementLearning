# traffic-management-using-neuralNetwork-DDPG-reinforcementLearning

In this we have used a dynamic approach to genrate the green time for a lane considering the future of the waiting time of other lanes, but since doing this for every state will be high computing as cars will keep getting added, so i have used neural network and train it on the green time generated by the dynamic approach. 

There are two models-
  1. DDPG Reinforcement Learning 
  2. Neural Network
