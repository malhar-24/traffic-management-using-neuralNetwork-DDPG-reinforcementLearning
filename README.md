# traffic-management-using-neuralNetwork-DDPG-reinforcementLearning

In this i have used a dynamic approach to genrate the green time for a lane considering the future of the waiting time of other lanes, but since doing this for every state will be high computing as cars will keep getting added, so i have used neural network and train it on the green time generated by the dynamic approach. 

In nn model the min loss was 0.005 on training with 20000 sample, 
and after testing with 5000 sample loss was 0.007

There are two models-
  1. DDPG Reinforcement Learning 
  2. Neural Network
